# 17th IHIW HLA Reference Allele Catalog

All 17th International HLA and Immunogenetics Workshop database functions used [IPD-IMGT/HLA Database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/)
version [3.25.0](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/imgt/mhc/hla/Allelelist.3250.txt) sequence information.
A set of reference HLA alleles for which "full length" consensus sequence was available in IPD-IMGT/HLA Database version 
3.25.0 was used to facilitate the use of this specific database version in NGS HLA Typing Reports.

Fore these purposes, "full length" refers to the 'genomic' sequences curated by the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database, which include 
sequence for all exons and introns, and the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). This reference allele catalog was assembled
for use in generating and aligning consensus sequences, and describing novel sequence variation. 

Though some of the allele names in this catalog have fewer than four fields, this indicates that no synonymous or non-coding 
polymorphism had been identified for those alleles as of IPD-IMGT/HLA Database version 3.25.0.

##
Reference alleles are provided for each HLA locus (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DRB1, -DRB3, -DRB4 and -DRB5)
and in some cases for specific allele families (e.g., HLA-A*01, HLA-A*02, HLA-A*03, etc.), when a full length allele is 
available and appropriate. Some alleles serve as both locus and allele family references, and some serve as references for
multiple allele families. No allele family reference alleles are provided for the HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 loci.

This catalog is available in this repository in three files: 
- [A list of alleles, ordered by locus and allele name](https://github.com/IHIW/bioinformatics/blob/master/reference_alleles/3.25.0_catalog/17IHIWS_Reference_Alleles.txt)
- [A list of alleles, ordered by category](https://github.com/IHIW/bioinformatics/blob/master/reference_alleles/3.25.0_catalog/17IHIWS_Reference_Categories.txt) -- locus references are shown first, followed by allelic family references
- [A ReadMe file](https://github.com/IHIW/bioinformatics/blob/master/reference_alleles/3.25.0_catalog/17IHIWS_Reference_README.txt) that provides more detail about the first two files
